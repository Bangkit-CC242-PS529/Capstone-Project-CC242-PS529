The Book Title Recommendation System Application is a user-focused platform that personalizes book suggestions based on preferences and reading habits. The system employs machine learning to analyze factors such as user ratings and reading history, ensuring tailored recommendations. Addressing the inefficiency and frustration often associated with book discovery, the application offers a seamless user experience through advanced technology integration. Combining machine learning, mobile development, and cloud computing, the project delivers a scalable and intuitive solution to enhance readersâ€™ literary journeys.
The project is divided into three main learning paths:
Machine Learning: Building a collaborative filtering model using TensorFlow, training the model with data including ratings, users, and book titles. After completing the training, a random sample is taken to test the model
Mobile Development: Developing a mobile application in Kotlin using Android Studio, with a focus on modern, user-friendly UI/UX crafted in Jetpack Compose Material 3. REST API implementation facilitates seamless communication with the backend services.
Cloud Computing: Backend services are deployed on Google Cloud Run to achieve scalable and efficient performance. FastAPI is utilized for building RESTful backend APIs, enabling smooth data exchange.
